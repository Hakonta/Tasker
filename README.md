# Tasker - A simple To-Do App made in React
<br>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
Nothing special to see here, except for a back-end developer doing some simple front-end development - Oh, as a fun little experiement, it was all made on my iPad!
<br><br>
I used Play.js for development and WorkingCopy for Git. 
<br><br>
I mostly followed <a href="https://ibaslogic.com">this</a> guide, but made my own adjustments as I saw fit.
